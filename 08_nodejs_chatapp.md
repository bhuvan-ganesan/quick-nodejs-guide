## What We Will Be Using to Build?
We will be using Node.js for the back end, which will be responsible for creating rooms and managing users in those rooms. Additionally, we will be using Socket.io to enable real-time, bidirectional communication between the web server and the client (browser).

## WebSocket and Socket.io
WebSocket is a communication protocol for having real-time, bidirectional, and low-latency communication between the web server and the browser. Socket.io is basically a JavaScript library built using the WebSocket API to enable all of this.

```
Browser/       -----------------------> Nodejs 
Nodejs Client <------------------------ Serve 
```
