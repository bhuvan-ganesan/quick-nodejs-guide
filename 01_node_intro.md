## What is Node.js ?
Node.js is an open-source server side runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
It provides an event driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment 
for building highly scalable server-side application using JavaScript.
Node.js can be used to build different types of applications such as command line application, web application, 
real-time chat application, REST API server etc. However, it is mainly used to build network programs like web servers, similar to PHP, Java, or ASP.NET. 
Node.js was written and introduced by Ryan Dahl in 2009.
